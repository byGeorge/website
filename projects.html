		<h3>NPC Generator</h3>
		<p>I play D&D. We're talking rolling dice every Saturday with 10 dyed-in-the-wool nerds. My DM (that's Dungeon Master for the uninitiated) has been begging me for a way to create and track NPC's (anybody in the world who isn't one of the players).</p>
		<p>This was my first Rails project. Now that I know more about HTML/CSS, I can improve the way it looks. It's also going a refactor. I know that the controllers for Rails apps can be huge, but I had an epiphany. There was a way I could cut the code down at least 60%, make it more modular and easier to read. So I'm doing that between this website's upgrade segments.</p>

				<dd>Previously hosted on Heroku. Was planning to use SQLite but Heroku didn't support it. Now that I know more about PostgreSQL, I probably wouldn't have cared about making the switch. PostgreSQL has more functionality than SQLite, and switching database types was easy. 10/10 would recommend</dd>

				<dd>Class assignment with a partner. She couldn't get Django to work on her computer, so her job was to fill up the database with all the pub quiz questions. There were a lot of them. Django was easy to use, but limited. It seems to be designed for dabblers.</dd>
