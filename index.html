			<h3>New!</h3>
			<p>As some of you know, I'm trying to find a job. Something great, something exciting where I can learn lots of new things. Many of the potential hires have wanted some experience with AWS, and I'd been looking for an option other than GoDaddy. So I've moved my Rails application over to AWS, and it's working much better here.</p>

			<p>Potential employers also seem to want more proficiency in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so I'm improving my skills. The last time I did anything extensive in HTML/CSS was in the '90's. JavaScript is a relatively new skill. It's SO much easier than I expected it to be. I've recently done some backend updates to make the site easier to manage.</p>

			<p>I got some feedback about this site. He said it was great, except that it looked like it was done in 1997. After a few question to get more specific suggestions, I've (hopefully) brought it up to date. I find the dark red and black colour scheme easy to look at, but it's also out of style. It'll be a night mode toggle and, just for fun, '80s mode. </p>

			<p>Edit: nope. He says 2005. We're getting closer, anyway. Apparently the blocky button look is out. I've never been terribly fashionable. Fortunately, I have friends who are.</p>

			<h3>Next!</h3>
			<p>I'll be attaching some of my projects (and adding a "projects" menu item) to this site. The <a href="http://npc-generator-dev.n3qa6v2tc2.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">NPC generator</a> already has an elastic beanstalk linux server connected, but I'd like to add more projects. I'd like to add more than the Rails server.</p>
